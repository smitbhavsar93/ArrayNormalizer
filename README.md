# ArrayNormalizer
Short code to normalize an array. One of my first .c programs with arrays.

## How to run code
For this code to work, drag and drop any of these .c files into a c programming compiler, the code for us was written on a software called Geany. 
Next, replace the "path" aka the "FILE* ptr = fopen("... **.txt**" , "r");" line of code and change the text file to any file of your choice, just make 
sure it is a .txt file and voila! Code will be able to run.

## Geany
This program was coded on Geany, to download Geany, visit : https://www.geany.org/download/releases/ and download their latest release on your compatible device.
